The code for the final project is located in the code folder. I have also included examples of codes used to prepare the spectra

there are three version of the dataset. the "final_dataset" is what I used in the end. the binary_dataset is a reduced dataset
that I created to simplify practice runs when I was struggling with multilabel classification. Lastly, the sensor_dataset
is the original version I had used, but has the misalignment problem
